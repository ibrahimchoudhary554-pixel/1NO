IBRAHIM'CONFESSION OF ALL THE THINGS HE HAS DONE IN 2025

I. The Descent (Post-9th Grade)
The year 2025 didn’t begin with a resolution; it began with a disappearance. Following the 9th-grade examinations, I embarked on a solitary pilgrimage to Lahore, a city of smoke and mirrors where I promptly tried to turn my lungs into a chimney. I returned not as a student, but as a ghost.

By May, I had "joined" an academy for the 10th grade, though my presence was purely theoretical. I orchestrated a month-long disappearance from school, leveraging a forged medical application—upheld by the dark magic of "references"—to bypass the system. I graced the halls of formal education for exactly one week the entire year. I cleared my Send-ups by some miracle of God and then never stepped foot on that cursed soil again.

II. The Vampire Routine & Digital Terrorism
For four months, I existed in a perpetual loop of sloth and "yakkis." My biological clock was shattered:

14:00: Rebirth/Breakfast.

15:00 – 17:00: Mindless digital consumption.

17:00 – 21:00: Academy (Purely for the aesthetics of chaos; my test papers remained as blank as my soul).

22:00 – 05:00: The Deep Web and the Downfall.

During these witching hours, I became a digital menace. I breached 19 Instagram accounts and 2 Facebook profiles. I stalked over a hundred souls. In a fit of delusions of grandeur, I attempted to breach a military jammer in Multan. I launched a DDoS offensive against the KIPS official website, successfully flatlining their servers for an hour.

Then came the hubris. I directed a bot-driven DDoS attack against the United States Department of Justice. Since that moment, my laptop has been "acting weird"—presumably because the FBI is currently installing a condo in my hard drive. Over 1,000 websites fell to my botnet. I was a king of nothing.

III. The August Zenith
In August, something broke. The "Wake-up Call." For thirty days, I played at being a human. I rose at 07:00. I cooked. I bled in the gym. I prayed five times a day. I studied for two hours. It was my peak—a brief, shining moment of discipline before the gravity of my own bullshit pulled me back down.

IV. The Eman Anomaly & The Wajeeh Vendetta
December brought Eman. She came with baggage—a past with Bilal and a current fixation on Hasnat. I treated her like a target, pouring in "effort" until the final ten days of the year when she finally uttered the words: "I love you too." It was the happiest I had ever been.

It lasted until Christmas. On December 25th, the simulation collapsed. She sent a "Goodbye" with no explanation. The rumors—dark and jagged—suggested that Eman Ali (Wajeeh’s ex) orchestrated the breakup as a scorched-earth revenge tactic because Wajeeh had discarded her. I tried to reach out; I was met with a void. I left her to the silence.

The fallout with the "other" Eman Ali ended in a flame war of heated arguments and mutual blocks. We remain in a state of cold war.

V. Current Status: The Aftermath
I am currently a walking chemical fire. Cigarettes, pods, and nicotine pouches are my only consistent companions. I have manipulated, I have lied, and I have buried secrets deep enough to hit the water table.

The Soha Case: A tragedy of stupidity. She actually believed I loved her. Poor girl.

The Warisha Maneuver: I have sent a follow request to Wajeeh’s current crush, Warisha, out of pure spite.

The Janita Incident: Wajeeh retaliated by using my own account to target Janita.
